## The week in review

I'll be posting a weekly review of the market, the good, the bad and the ugly, reviewing the market from multiple points of view:
* Technical
* Fundamental
* Sentimental
* Institutional
* Macro
* Value investing
* Short term view
* Long term view

## Institutionals

I'll be discussing the institutional view of the market, what are the big players doing, what are they saying, what are they buying and selling.
Harnett from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Kolanovic from JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, McElligot from Nomura are some of my favorite institutionals. Other hedge fund managers I like includes Stanley Druckenmiller, George Soros, Warren Buffet, Paul Tudor Jones, and Bill Ackman.

I'll take notes on what they say and do and figure out if they were correct or incorrect in the future; I enjoy doing this because it's a great method to learn. We all read what they say, but we don't go over it as often as we should.

* UBS joins Goldman and Morgan Stanley and also cuts China stock outlook.
* Euro zone inflation expectations gauge plummets to seven-year low.
* Berkshire Hathaway increases its stake in Occidental Petroleum to 25%.
* Goldman: We believe the S&P 500 will rise 7% over the next 12 months.

## The good

Many positive developments are taking place in the market, which I am going to cover here.

* The AI narrative remains compelling. And artificial intelligence is a fact that is here to stay. However, it has the potential to become a bubble, so we must exercise caution. I dislike going against the grain, but I'll be on the lookout for indicators of a bubble.
* July is traditionally a favorable month for the market. I don't see any signals of a bear market yet, and the market is still positive. I'll be on the lookout for signals of a bear market and will publish them here.
* The market remains bullish, and I see no symptoms of a bear market. I'll be on the lookout for signals of a bear market and will publish them here.
* Interest rates can rise, but not too much or too quickly; inflation is declining and appears to be under control. When inflation is excessive and then slows, the market normally rises.
* Since M2 is still rising, the market may continue to rise.
* The first half of the year was fantastic, and the second half of the year is usually good.
* We continue to see good earnings surprises.
* From a technical point of view, the market is still in a bull market. The continuation of the bear market will be an anomaly.

## The bad

What are the dangers?

* The market's long term value is high, but it may go higher.
* A few stocks (A.I. mainly) are outperforming the market, while the others are underperforming or plain flat.

## The ugly

There will always be reasons to be bearish, and I will keep looking for them and post them here.

* Macroeconomic data is mixed; inflation is high but slowing, and the economy is growing but not as quickly as projected.
* The interest rates curve inversion predicted a recession in 2023, but I'm not seeing any symptoms of it now.
* Many short term sentiment indicators indicate that the market is overly bullish. But that might last for a long time.

## Overview

My view of the market for the next month is bullish. For the longer term, I'm still fairly bullish, but I'm cautious, I'd like to see earnings and macro improving.
