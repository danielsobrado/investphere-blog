## The week in review

I'll be posting a weekly review of the market, the good, the bad and the ugly, reviewing the market from multiple points of view:
* Technical
* Fundamental
* Sentimental
* Institutional
* Macro
* Value investing
* Short term view
* Long term view

## Institutionals

I'll be discussing the institutional view of the market, what are the big players doing, what are they saying, what are they buying and selling.
Harnett from Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Kolanovic from JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, McElligot from Nomura are some of my favorite institutionals. Other hedge fund managers I like includes Stanley Druckenmiller, George Soros, Warren Buffet, Paul Tudor Jones, and Bill Ackman.

I'll take notes on what they say and do and figure out if they were correct or incorrect in the future; I enjoy doing this because it's a great method to learn. We all read what they say, but we don't go over it as often as we should.

* UBS joins Goldman and Morgan Stanley and also cuts China stock outlook.
* Euro zone inflation expectations gauge plummets to seven-year low.
* Berkshire Hathaway increases its stake in Occidental Petroleum to 25%.

## The good

We've seen many good things happening in the market, and I'll be reviewing them here.

* The AI narrative is still strong. And AI is a reality, and it's here to stay. But it may become a bubble, and we should be careful with it. I don't like going against the trend, but I'll be looking for signs of a bubble.
* July is usually a good month for the market.
* The market is still bullish, and I don't see any signs of a bear market yet. I'll be looking for signs of a bear market, and I'll be posting them here.
* Interest rates can increase, but not too much, and not too fast anymore, inflation is falling, and looks like it will be under control. When the inflation is high and decelerates, the market usually goes up.
* M2 is still growing, so the market should go up.
* The first half of the year was great, and the second half of the year is usually good too afterwards.
* We are still having positive earnings surprises.
* The market is still in a bull market, from a technical point of view. The continuation for the bear market will be an oddity at this point.

## The bad

What are the risks?

* For the long term, the valuation of the market is high, but can be higher.
* A few stocks (AI) are leading the market, and the rest of the stocks are not doing so well.

## The ugly

There are always reasons to be bearish, and I'll be looking for them, and posting them here.

* Macro data is mixed, inflation is high, but decelerating, and the economy is growing, but not as fast as expected.
* We could expect a recession in 2023, as anticipated by the curve inversion, but I don't see any signs of it yet.
* There are many sentiment indicators that are showing that the market is too bullish. But that can stay like that for a long time.

## Overview

My view of the market for the next month is bullish. For the longer term, I'm still bullish, but I'm cautious.
