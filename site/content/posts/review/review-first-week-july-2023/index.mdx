## The week in review

A fairly flat week, with mixed macro data. Everything points to a soft landing that the market loves.

The American shopper is drowning in debt... As interest rates continue to rise and new car prices stay high, the number of new auto loans with monthly payments over $1,000 has reached a new record high. 

The Nasdaq 100 had a very strong second quarter and history suggests that it may continue to outperform the S&P in the third quarter. 

## Notable news

News and data that move the market:
* Musk predicts Tesla autonomous cars this year.
* ChatGPT reached 100M users in 2 months. Facebook Threads a direct competitor from Twitter has surpassed 70M registrations in 2 days.


## Institutionals

The institutional view of the market, what are the big players doing, what are they saying, what are they buying and selling.

* Bond fund giant Pimco braces for a harder landing for the global economy.
* Bridgewater's Greg Jensen sees 'bad' outlook for bonds and stocks.

## The bad

What are the risks?

* Euro zone PMI fell to 49.9 from 50.3 and 52.8 in the previous month, which is another sign that the economy is shrinking. PMI dropped to 49.9, while last month's predictions were between 50.3 and 52.8.
* The Eurozone producer price index (PPI) shows deflation for the first time in several years. With a fall of -1.5% over the last 12 months.
* U.S. ISM manufacturing PMI (June): 46.0 (forecast 47.2, previous 46.9)
* The U.S. added 209,000 jobs in June, below expectations of 225,000. (Note relevant)

## The ugly

* Yield curve remains strongly inverted.
* At 19-20x, US forward P/E is expensive.
* The VIX is close to a record low, and FOMO is in full force.
* In June, allocation to equities rose to 66%, the highest level in 13 years... allocation to bonds fell below its historical average of 15.9% for the 28th consecutive month.

## Overview

The FED continues to be hawkish, there might be one or two raises more. The inflation is under control.

The key is the liquidity. Markets are cooling down because of a lack of liquidity.

In the medium term, I believe that we might have a correction once the recession kicks in, but the FED will be able to reduce the impact of the recession by cutting rates.

From a technical analysis perspective, the market continues in a uptrend.

> The FED wants to scare us with more interest rates raises, but it might not do it. it is their plan to keep the financial conditions tight.
