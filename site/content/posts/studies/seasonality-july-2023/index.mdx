## July Seasonality in S&P 500: A Detailed Look

July is a fascinating month when it comes to the stock market, as it often brings a mixture of trends and variances. For our purposes today, we will scrutinize the seasonality of July in the S&P 500, and delve deeper into sector-wise seasonality.

These values represent the average returns for each day in July. It's quite notable that July 1st is, on average, the strongest day of the year in terms of returns, with a value of 0.71%. Please note, however, that the 4th of July is a holiday, so the market is closed.

Also, observe the remarkable swing in returns, particularly on July 16th, when the average return plummets to -0.42%, making it one of the weaker days in July.

## Sector-wise Seasonality in July

The Technology sector also shows substantial variability, but generally maintains a positive trajectory.
