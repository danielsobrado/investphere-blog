## Understanding the Benner Cycle: A Peek into the World of Market Cycles

Hello Readers and wellcome to Investphere!

Are you ready for a little financial adventure? Today, we're stepping off the beaten track to explore a curiosity from the world of market cycles - the Benner Cycle. Samuel Benner, a farmer with an immense curiosity in financial markets, created a new forecasting technique in the nineteenth century. 

## What is the Benner Cycle?

The Benner Cycle is a curiosity that identifies three distinct types of years in the financial market:

* **Panic Years**: These are years when the market behaves in an unpredictable manner, either buying or selling a stock excessively, leading to significant price changes.
* **Good Times**: These are the years which Benner marked as periods of high prices, making them the ideal time to sell stocks and assets.
* **Hard Times**: These years are best for buying stocks and assets. Hold on to them until the "boom" years of good times, and then it's time to sell.

## The Curious Origins of the Benner Cycle

Benner was a farmer, a profession that revolves around understanding and working with natural cycles. He applied this cyclical understanding to the financial markets and came up with a model that has shown surprising accuracy over the years.

## The Mechanics of the Benner Cycle

Benner noticed that seasonal cycles impacted crop yields, which in turn influenced supply and demand, and ultimately commodity prices. He discovered an 11-year cycle in corn and pig prices, with peaks every 5/6 years. Interestingly, this aligns with the 11-year solar cycle. He also found a 27-year cycle in pig iron prices with lows every 11, 9, 7 years and peaks coming in at 8, 9, 10 years.

## The Benner Cycle and Future Predictions

The Benner Cycle has been used to make future market predictions. 

> It anticipates 2023 to be a market bottom, indicating a good time to buy. After that, 2026 is anticipated to be a year with high prices, suggesting a good time to sell.

It's important to stress that, although being an intriguing idea, you shouldn't base your financial choices on this. 

## Wrapping Up

The Benner Cycle offers a fascinating insight into how patterns and cycles can provide a unique perspective on market behavior. While not to be taken too seriously, it is a stimulating topic to consider.
